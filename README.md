# NWM_Coding_Challenge_Cards
This repository contains the implementation and test coverage of dealing cards to a number of players.  When the program is started the user will be prompted to enter the number of players to deal a deck of 52 shuffled cards to. Players will be delt the same number of cards. As an example if there are 4 players each will get 13 cards with no cards left in the deck. If there are 5 players then they will each recieve 10 cards with 2 cards left over in the deck.  After the cards are delt the console will display the cards cooresponding to each player.
